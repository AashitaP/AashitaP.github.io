          I'm a Singaporean, Computer Science student at UCLA. I love art, music and travel and have dedicated most of my time in UCLA to social justice on campus and coding. I initially started off as a business economics major but through getting my hands dirty in my first coding project in a hackathon mid year 1, I soon discovered that the CS field better catered to my passion for problem solving and making meaningful difference. 
          <br /> <br /> 
          Throughout my college experience, I've seeked learning opportunities wherever possible, whether be it through taking up online courses to learn Python, iOS app development and R during my spare time, or involving myself in leadership on campus to better acclimatise myself with social justice issues such as mental health, learning about different cultures, and carrying out projects to better the UCLA community. 
          <br /> <br /> I'm currently working as a student web developer for UCLA External Affairs through which I seek to gain real work experience while learning on the job.
